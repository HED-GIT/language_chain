# c_all_lib_call

a c program that should call libraries written in different languages which then call librarys in all the other languages

## languages

- ada
- c
- c++
- cobol
- d
- fortran
- go
- nim
- objective-c
- odin
- pascal
- rust
- swift
- zig

## todos

- rust_chain not using generated .rs files for nim
- nim_call should use native print instead of prints from c
- something acts weird in docker (fortran doesn't seem to be the problem), okay fortran is the problem
